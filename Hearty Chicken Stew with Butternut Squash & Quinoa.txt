Serves: Serves 6
Ingredients
11⁄2 lb. butternut squash, peeled, seeded & chopped into 1⁄2-inch pieces
31⁄2 cups chicken broth
11⁄2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 tbsp olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
1⁄2 tsp kosher salt
4 cloves garlic, minced
11⁄2 tsp dried oregano
1 can (14 oz) petite diced tomatoes
2⁄3 cup uncooked quinoa
3⁄4 cup pitted and quartered kalamata olives
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1⁄4 cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
Instructions
1. Steam the butternut squash until barely tender, about 10 minutes. Remove half of the squash pieces and
set aside.
2. Steam the remaining squash until very tender, an additional 4 to 6 minutes. Mash this squash with the
back of a fork. Set aside.
3. In a large saucepan set over medium-high heat, bring the chicken broth to a simmer.
4. Add chicken thighs, cover, and cook until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.
5. Transfer the chicken thighs to a plate and allow to cool. Pour broth into a medium-sized bowl.
6. Return the saucepan to the stovetop and lower heat to medium. Add olive oil.
7. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is starting to turn brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
8. Add the salt, minced garlic and oregano. Cook, stirring, for 1 additional minute.
9. To the saucepan, add tomatoes, butternut squash pieces, mashed butternut squash. Stir to combine.
10. Stir in reserved chicken broth and quinoa. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook until the quinoa turns
translucent, about 15 minutes.
11. Shred the chicken with your fingers or a fork.
12. Stir the chicken, olives and pepper into the stew and simmer, uncovered, to heat, about 5 minutes.
13. Stir in parsley and serve.
